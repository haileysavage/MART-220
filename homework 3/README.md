# Reflection on the Generative AI image

## Sushi Background

### What I asked for:
- **My Prompt**: "Can you create me a sushi restaraunt background, I want it minimalistic with neutral colors" 
- **ChatGPT**: I liked what it gave me, but I realized I wanted it to be a table not a whole restaraunt so I asked it to change some things
- **Prompt Two**: "I actually want it to be just a table, and I would like things to be on the table. Make it a little less realistic (more cartoony)"
- **ChatGPT**: Once again I liked what it gave me, but I wanted a different view of the table 
- **Prompt Three**: "yes! but more of a birdseye/ straight down or more zoomed in version of the table"
- **ChatGPT**: Gave me the final product of what I was looking for

### Why I used ChatGPT
I decided to use ChatGPT because I’m already familiar with it and rely on it for various tasks. Since it’s a tool I frequently use, it made the most sense to incorporate it into this project.

### Was it what I expected?
Yes and no. This was my first time using ChatGPT to generate images, making it a new and exciting process. I anticipated needing multiple prompts to refine the image to my liking, but I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly I achieved the result I wanted.
