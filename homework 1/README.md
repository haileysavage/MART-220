# Sushi vs. Spaghetti and Meatballs in p5.js

## Sushi Roll Portrait - mine

### Key Features
- **Plate**: A large gray ellipse represents the sushi plate.
- **Nori (Seaweed)**: A green rectangle with rounded corners represents the seaweed wrapping.
- **Rice and Salmon**: A white ellipse for the rice base and a pink-orange ellipse for the salmon topping.
- **Avocado Slice**: A green arc adds dimension and variety to the design.
- **Fish Roe**: Small red ellipses provide detail and a pop of color.
- **Label**: Text is added for context and to identify the dish.

### Artistic Considerations
This design uses symmetry and a centralized layout to create a clean and simple representation of sushi. The colors are soft and complementary, emphasizing the fresh and natural look of the ingredients.

## Spaghetti and Meatballs - ChatGPT

### Key Features
- **Plate**: A light blue ellipse simulates a shallow, wide plate for the spaghetti.
- **Spaghetti Noodles**: Yellow ellipses are randomly placed to mimic the appearance of tangled pasta.
- **Meatballs**: Brown circles are scattered across the spaghetti to add depth and variety.
- **Grated Cheese**: Small, semi-transparent white ellipses are sprinkled over the spaghetti for added detail.

### Artistic Considerations
The design emphasizes randomness to capture the organic, messy look of spaghetti. The bright yellow of the noodles contrasts with the dark brown of the meatballs, creating a vibrant and appetizing effect.

## Reflection 

Both portraits showcase unique approaches to food art in p5.js, highlighting the versatility of simple shapes and colors to represent food dishes. However my version is a lot more simple while ChatGPT added extra elements such as depth. I do think my sushi roll looks better than the spaghetti and meatballs; due to ChatGPT using depth the noodles dont really look like noodles, and more so like rice or orzo.
